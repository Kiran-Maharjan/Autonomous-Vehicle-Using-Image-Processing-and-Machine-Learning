to remove error in cost funciton the follwoing codes were removed:
In functions used file inside nnCostFunction:
line 36: c = np.zeros(num_labels)
line 63: c[0] = 0
line 64: for j in range(1,10):
line 65: 	c[j] = j

line 67: if (y[i] == 10):
line 68: 	y[i] = 0

line 70: newy = (c == y[i])

Previously newy mentioned above was used as vector for actual output which was subtracted from h.
In place of these codes follwoing code was used to generate a vector to represent actual output:

init_y = np.zeros((m,num_labels))
for i in range(m):
    init_y[i][y[i]] = 1

And inside the loop:
'init_y[i][:,None]' replaced 'newy[:,None]'
